# Activity 2

## Scripts

The scripts block defines different actions that can be taken within the project. For example the script "start" can be run in the project with the command `npm start`. When that command is run, it will run the command defined with the "start" key.

Other scripts that can be run include `npm run analyze` `npm run storybook` and `npm run build-storybook`
